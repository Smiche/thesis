	abstract = {This survey paper presents a classification of different challenges and tracking techniquesin the field of augmented reality. The challenges in augmented reality arecategorized into performance challenges, alignment challenges, interaction challenges,mobility/portability challenges and visualization challenges. Augmentedreality tracking techniques are mainly divided into sensor-based tracking, visionbasedtracking and hybrid tracking. The sensor-based tracking is further dividedinto optical tracking, magnetic tracking, acoustic tracking, inertial tracking or anycombination of these to form hybrid sensors tracking. Similarly, the vision-basedtracking is divided into marker-based tracking and markerless tracking. Eachtracking technique has its advantages and limitations. Hybrid tracking provides arobust and accurate tracking but it involves financial and tehnical difficulties.},
